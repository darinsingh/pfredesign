                        <div class="postparagraph">Federal investigators in Manhattan executed search warrants early
                            Wednesday at the home and office of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who
                            became President Donald J. Trump’s personal lawyer, stepping up a criminal investigation
                            into Mr. Giuliani’s dealings in Ukraine, three people with knowledge of the investigation
                            said.

                            The investigators seized Mr. Giuliani’s electronic devices and searched his Madison Avenue
                            apartment and his Park Avenue office at about 6 a.m., two of the people said.

                            The execution of search warrants is an extraordinary action for prosecutors to take against
                            a lawyer, let alone a lawyer for a former president. It was a major development in the
                            long-running investigation into Mr. Giuliani and a remarkable moment in his long arc as a
                            public figure.

                            As mayor, Mr. Giuliani won national recognition for steering New York through the dark days
                            after the Sept. 11 attacks, and earlier in his career, he led the same U.S. attorney’s
                            office in Manhattan that is investigating him now, earning a reputation as a hard-charging
                            prosecutor who took on organized crime and corrupt politicians.

                            In recent years, however, his image has been sullied by his effort to help Mr. Trump to dig
                            up dirt in Ukraine on President Biden’s son and Mr. Trump’s repeated attempts in court to
                            overturn the results of the 2020 election with baseless claims of widespread fraud.

                            Mr. Giuliani’s lawyer, Robert J. Costello, called the searches unnecessary because his
                            client had offered to answer prosecutors’s questions, except those regarding Mr. Giuliani’s
                            privileged communications with the former president.

                            “What they did today was legal thuggery,” Mr. Costello said. “Why would you do this to
                            anyone, let alone someone who was the associate attorney general, United States attorney,
                            the mayor of New York City and the personal lawyer to the 45th president of the United
                            States.”

                            F.B.I. agents on Wednesday morning also executed a search warrant at the Washington-area
                            home of Victoria Toensing, a lawyer close to Mr. Giuliani who had dealings with several
                            Ukrainians involved in seeking negative information on the Bidens, according to people with
                            knowledge of that warrant, which sought her phone.

                            apartment and his Park Avenue office at about 6 a.m., two of the people said.

                            The execution of search warrants is an extraordinary action for prosecutors to take against
                            a lawyer, let alone a lawyer for a former president. It was a major development in the
                            long-running investigation into Mr. Giuliani and a remarkable moment in his long arc as a
                            public figure.

                            As mayor, Mr. Giuliani won national recognition for steering New York through the dark days
                            after the Sept. 11 attacks, and earlier in his career, he led the same U.S. attorney’s
                            office in Manhattan that is investigating him now, earning a reputation as a hard-charging
                            prosecutor who took on organized crime and corrupt politicians.

                            In recent years, however, his image has been sullied by his effort to help Mr. Trump to dig
                            up dirt in Ukraine on President Biden’s son and Mr. Trump’s repeated attempts in court to
                            overturn the results of the 2020 election with baseless claims of widespread fraud.

                            Mr. Giuliani’s lawyer, Robert J. Costello, called the searches unnecessary because his
                            client had offered to answer prosecutors’s questions, except those regarding Mr. Giuliani’s
                            privileged communications with the former president.

                            “What they did today was legal thuggery,” Mr. Costello said. “Why would you do this to
                            anyone, let alone someone who was the associate attorney general, United States attorney,
                            the mayor of New York City and the personal lawyer to the 45th president of the United
                            States.”

                            F.B.I. agents on Wednesday morning also executed a search warrant at the Washington-area
                            home of Victoria Toensing, a lawyer close to Mr. Giuliani who had dealings with several
                            Ukrainians involved in seeking negative information on the Bidens, according to people with
                            knowledge of that warrant, which sought her phone.

                        <div class="postparagraph">Federal investigators in Manhattan executed search warrants early
                            Wednesday at the home and office of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who
                            became President Donald J. Trump’s personal lawyer, stepping up a criminal investigation
                            into Mr. Giuliani’s dealings in Ukraine, three people with knowledge of the investigation
                            said.

                            The investigators seized Mr. Giuliani’s electronic devices and searched his Madison Avenue
                            apartment and his Park Avenue office at about 6 a.m., two of the people said.
